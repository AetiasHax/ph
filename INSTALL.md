    - [Building with non-matching code](#building-with-non-matching-code)

## Prerequisites

1. Use one of these platforms:
    - Windows (recommended)
    - Linux
2. Install the following:
    - Python 3.11+ and pip
    - GCC 9+
    - Ninja
    - **On Linux**: Wine/Wibo
3. Install the Python dependencies:
```shell
python -m pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```
4. Run the setup script:
```shell
python tools/setup.py
```
5. Run the Ninja configure script:
```shell
python tools/configure.py <eur|usa>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rerun `configure.py` often to ensure that all C/C++ code gets compiled.

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux users: If you plan to use Wibo instead of Wine, run `configure.py` with `-w <path/to/wibo>`.
6. Put one or more base ROMs in the [`/extract/`](/extract/README.md) directory of this repository.

Now you can run `ninja` to build a ROM for the chosen version.

### Matching the base ROM

**This is optional!** You only need to follow these steps if you want a matching ROM.

First, [extract the ARM7 BIOS from your DS device](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/ds-index/ds-bios-firmware-dump). Put the
ARM7 BIOS in the root directory of this repository, and verify that your dumped BIOS matches the one below:

| File name       | SHA1                                       | 
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `arm7_bios.bin` | `6ee830c7f552c5bf194c20a2c13d5bb44bdb5c03` |

Now, rerun `configure.py` so it can update `build.ninja` to build a matching ROM.
