## Actor IDs
Many actors have a 4-character ID associated with it. This table shows all known IDs and their respective meanings or
translations. Feel free to contribute to this list!

> [!NOTE]
> These IDs will appear in memory in reverse order. This is because allocation IDs are often interpreted as 32-bit integers,
> and integers are stored in little-endian which effectively "reverses" the character order.
