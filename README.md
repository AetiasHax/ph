# The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass

**Work in progress!** This project aims to recreate source code for ***The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass*** by decompiling
assembly code by hand. **The repository does not contain assets or assembly code.** To build the ROM, you must own an existing
copy of the game to extract assets from.

**Note:** The project targets the European and American versions, and other versions might be supported later.
