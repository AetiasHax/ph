# The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass

**Work in progress!** This project aims to recreate source code for ***The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass*** by decompiling
assembly code by hand. **The repository only contains code.** To build the ROM, you must own an existing copy of the game to
extract assets from.

**Note:** The project only targets the European version, and other versions might be supported later.

## How to install
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for instructions on how to install the project.
